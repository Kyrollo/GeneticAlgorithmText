# GeneticAlgorithmText

This repository contains a Python implementation of a genetic algorithm to evolve a string towards a target phrase. The algorithm uses a population of strings, selection, crossover, and mutation to iteratively improve the population until the target phrase is found.

## Description (optional)

The project demonstrates the use of a genetic algorithm to solve a text-matching problem. The algorithm starts with a random population of strings and uses genetic operations to evolve the population towards the target phrase. This can be a useful educational tool for learning about genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation.

## Features

- Initializes a population of random strings.
- Calculates fitness based on the number of differing characters from the target.
- Selects the fittest individuals for reproduction.
- Applies crossover and mutation to generate new offspring.
- Replaces the old population with the new generation.

## Usage

To run the script, you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
